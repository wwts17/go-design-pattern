# Design Patterns
> Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems in software engineering.
Rather than a comprehensive solution, a design pattern is a description of a
problem and a template of how to solve it. This template then becomes usable
in many different contexts.

# Design principles
- Responsibility 责任分配
- Dependency management 依赖管理

# SOLID
- Single Responsibility Principles(S) 单一职责
    > One class should have one, and only one, responsibility
- Open/Closed Principle(O) 开闭原则
    > You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying it.
- Liskov Substitution Princuple(L) 里氏替换原则
    > Derived types must be substitutable for their base types.
- Interface Segregation Principle(I) 接口隔离原则
    > Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- Dependency Inversion Principle(D) 依赖倒置原则
    > Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
